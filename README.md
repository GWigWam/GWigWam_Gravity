# GWigWam_Gravity
"Totally realistic" simulation of coloured balls flying through darkness.

Hobby project I created a few years back (+/- 2010), not under active development.

See [release.zip](release.zip) for a compiled version. To run:

 - Extract all the files in the .zip
 - Run the Gravity.jar file
